    Join

Joins help to combine data from multiple tables into one result set.
    Types of Join
1. INNER JOIN-- It give only data that matches from multiple tables into one result set.
2. LEFT JOIN-- It retrieves all records from the left table and matching record from the right table.
3. RIGHT JOIN-- It retrieves all records from the right table and matching record from the left table.
4. FULL OUTER JOIN-- This is the UNION of both LEFT and RIGHT JOINS, it retrieve all records from the left and right table, it matches data that match from both and fill the rest with NULL.
